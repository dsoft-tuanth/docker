# Introduction to Docker
__DOCKER__ is computer software used for Virtualization in order to have multiple Operating systems running on the same host. Unlike Hypervisors which are used for creating VM (Virtual machines), virtualization in Docker is performed on system-level in so-called Docker containers.

As you can see the difference in the image below, Docker containers run on top of the host's Operation system. This helps you to improves efficiency and security. Moreover, we can run more containers on the same infrastructure than we can run Virtual machines because containers use fewer resources.
